Some basic high-precision math functions




This little program demonstrates the ability of VB to
go beyond the built-in 16 digit level of precision.

It demonstrates the computation of the sine, cosine,
tangent, square root and cube root of an argument
to a precision of up to 28 significant digits.

In my work, I often encounter special situations where
a higher level of precision is required, so I thought I'd
share some of the basic routines I use to achieve it.
